## Architecture

![architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66a1a5bc-46a8-4d4b-8f96-728cc1518a1a)


Recommendation Bot uses ...
- LLM to generate Recommendation tags and final response.
- When user queries the chatbot, based on previous chat history and current query it generate recommendation Tags 
- This tags are later used for key mapping dictionary to generate final tags. This Tag dictionary allows more control over generated Tags and makes the product searching more efficient. (ie if a LLM generates tag `summer`, Tag dictionary extends these tags like `summer clothing`, `light cloths`, `shorts`, `cotton`, `relax fit`, `tank tops` etc.)  
- These Generated Tags are later used for similarity search and most similar products are returned by milvus.
- Details of these products and user query and earlier chat context is again provided to LLM to generate final human like response. Which is later accessed by frontend and displayed to user.
